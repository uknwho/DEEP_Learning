# Identifying the musical instrument from its Spectrograph Images.

Every Musical intrument have a specific pattern in thier respective spectrograph images. Using this images, a deep neural network can be developed which can identify to which Instrument the spectrograph belongs.

The Network has been trained to detect 14 instruments 
1) Bells
2) Cello
3) Clarinet
4) Crotales
5) Double Bass
6) Flute
7) Piano
8) Saxophone
9) Trombone
10) Trumpet
11) Vibraphone
12) Viola
13) Violin
14) Xylophone

The spectrogram images of these instruments were obtained from MATHWORKS, in association with University of Iowa Music. Alex Net was modified with Transfer learning, 70.06% acccuracy was achieved. Further modifications on training options led to an accuracy of 88.62%, this was with the Transfer Learning. The Results have been shared as "result_1.png" and "result_2.png"
